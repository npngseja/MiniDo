+ sync over cloud for every data modification is ok?
+ some process has nested function calls, each of which can be failed. we need a revert functionality to cancel failed process (it can happen on Core Data Stack)
+ known issues:
    - make todo text empty in detail view and close the app. the todo appears on todo list.

- maximum todo count --> todo: prompt 'reached max'

- test get all todos from server with completely new prios. how to sync them while avoiding isDirty todos messed up?
