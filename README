Little Wonder - Mini ToDo List App

# What you can do:
- Create a task
- Re-order tasks
- List up done tasks
- Delete a task

# ToDo data model to support re-order in an efficient way:
- Each Task has 'float' priority
- re-order a task is done by changing its priority such as new_prio = (last lower prio + next higher prio)/2
- if a task is re-ordered, we do not need to update other tasks, we can change just the target task, and notify it to the server. In this way, we can save network traffics
- Comparing with 'linked-list'-based approaches, it is probably more robust against data corruption.


# Notes:
- supporting iOS 9.0 or later
- open in Xcode 7 to compile the project
- no external libs. no cocoapods.
