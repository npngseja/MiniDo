//  NOTE: THIS CLASS DOES NOT HAVE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION!
//
//  NSURLConnection is quite old class to make a http request, so it is preferred to use NSURLSession
//  or AFNetworking framework instead. Still, I give here just interface to make several http requests
//  simultaneously and get correct responses for each requests.
//
//  Cancelling running connection is also very important to save network resources. This class shows
//  how to manage cancelled connection.
//
//  But NSURLSession or AFNetworking do those stuff much better....
